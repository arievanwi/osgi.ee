Entity factory management. Takes care of constructing entity managers based on registered entity manager factories. These
entity managers are registered as services in the OSGi service registry and therefore can be used from various bundles
to access beans. Suggestion is to limit this behaviour to only one bundle that contains the DAO(s), but in some situations it
may be required to split DAOs over multiple bundles. The idea of registering entity managers this way and using a global
transaction manager is from the enroute project.
